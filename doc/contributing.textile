h3(#building). Building From Source

Vanity is tested against multiple Ruby implementations, and a variety of database engines. To make life easier, we use "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ and "Bundler":http://gembundler.com/ to set up the test/development environment.

To test Vanity for the first time with whichever Ruby implementation you're currently using:

<pre>
$ rake test:setup
$ rake test
</pre>

To test Vanity with all supported adapters, or a specific adapter:

<pre>
$ rake test:adapters
$ rake test:adapters[redis]
</pre>

To test Vanity with all supported Ruby implementations, or a specific implementation:

<pre>
$ rake test:rubies
$ rake test:rubies[1.9.2]
$ # or
$ rvm 1.9.2@vanity rake test
</pre>

If you have RVM installed, @rake test:rubies@ will install all the supported Ruby implementations and populate the @vanity@ gemset for you. To test all supported adapters, you will also need to install Redis. If working on the Mac, you can easily install them all using "Homebrew":http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew.

To package Vanity as a gem and install on your machine:

<pre>
$ rake install
</pre>
