title: Configuring the Playground
---

Vanity will work out of the box on a default configuration.  Assuming you're using Redis on localhost, post 6379, there's nothing special to do.

If you run a different setup, use the playground object to configure Vanity.  For example:

<pre>
Vanity.playground.load_path = "exp"
Vanity.playground.establish_connection "redis://db.example.com"
</pre>

Configuration options are:

|_. name      |_. Is all about ...                    |_. Default      |
| load_path   | Directory containing experiment files | experiments    |
| logger      | This should be obvious                | default/Rails  |

Database connection information is loaded from @config/vanity.yml@, based on the current environment (@RACK_ENV@ or @RAILS_ENV@). If your application has no configuration file and does not establish a connection directly, Vanity will automatically connect to the Redis instance running on @localhost@ at port 6379.

When "running under Rails":rails.html, Vanity defaults to using the Rails logger, locates the load_path relative to Rails root and will use the @config/vanity.yml@ configuration file, if present.
